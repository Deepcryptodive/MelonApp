= documentation of multimanager module

This module aims to enable multiple persons to manage a fund on the `@melonproject/protocol`.

== preliminaries

Use metamask browser extension (https://metamask.io/) as wallet and use https://faucet.kovan.network/ to get some kovan TESTNETether. There you also can export the PRIVATE_KEYs to integrate in the `.env.js` file.

First of all you need:

1. one invested fund (1 WETH)
2. one multiSigWallet (min. 2 Owner)
3. one invested fund wit multiManager

=== 1. invested fund

To invest into a fund you need the `PRIVATE_KEYsrc` variable set with a minimum balance of 3 ETH (approx. 1.5 ETH per fund).
